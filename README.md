# An integrated framework for recommender model development and deployment

## Introduction

<p></p>
Inspired by the Surprise libraryâ€™s infrastructure, and the application of Deep Neural Network (DNN) to the recommender system, I come up with an idea to integrate the model development and deployment pipeline into a recommender framework. I name it Integrated Framework.
The integrated framework (IF) has 4 components:
* Data Management
* Model Design
* Model Evaluation
* Model Deployment
