# An integrated framework for recommender model development and deployment

## Introduction

Inspired by the Surprise library’s infrastructure, and the application of Deep Neural Network (DNN) to the recommender system, I come up with an idea to integrate the model development and deployment pipeline into a recommender framework. I name it Integrated Framework.

The integrated framework (IF) has 4 components:
- Data Management
* Model Design
* Model Evaluation
* Model Deployment

To summarize the highlights of IF:
- Support both explicit rating data and implicit rating data (slide 4)
Support various data splitting schemes (slide 4)
Support both Collaborative Filtering models and Deep Neural Network based models (slide 5)
Support various recommendation tasks (slide 5)
Support model evaluation metrics for various recommendation tasks (slide 7)
Support analyzing and comparing the model(s) performance (slide 7)
Support various optimization approaches (slide 7)
Support model packaging that is useable across the enterprise (slide 9)
